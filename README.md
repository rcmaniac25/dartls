Dart ls
-------

The common [ls](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ls.html) utility from *nix based operating systems, written in Dart.

This is part of an attempt to learn a programming language and write an application in said language every month. For the month of Febuary 2017, that language was [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).

Not nearly enough time was spent working on this. I should've worked on this every day to every other day. Instead I worked on it every couple days to a week.

All unfinished tasks are located in the Issues tab.
